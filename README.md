# Depression-suicidal-tendencies-in-tweets

In this model I have used two datasets from kaggle, one is a collection of random tweets and one is just depressive tweets. I'm pasting the drive link for them both 
below. I have mounted them from my drive in this notebook to work with them, you can download and use it however you want.
